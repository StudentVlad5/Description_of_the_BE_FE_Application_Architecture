### 1. Executive Summary

1. Lightweight SDKs - Client Library: JS, Python, Java, Go;
   that capture errors, attach context, and send batched events to a public REST API.

2. API - when backend get errors from SDK, in Go or Node.js for rapid prototypes behind an edge proxy (Envoy/CloudFront), validating, rate-limiting traffic, queue and so on.

3. Processing pipeline (consumers) that enrich events, deduplicate/group them, and persist metadata to a fast analytical DB (ClickHouse) and store raw payloads in object storage (S3). Important to understand the scale of the project, because we can't fixating on the one DB.

4. Search index (OpenSearch/Elasticsearch) for fast text & stacktrace search.

5. Operational DB (Postgres, MongoDB) for tenants, projects, users, billing and feature flags. That's help to manage with data in short period of time.

6. Web dashboard built with React + TypeScript, exposing UI to explore errors, filter, group, triage, and manage alerts (React-google-charts, Recharts).

7. Alerts delivered via email (SES/SendGrid) and webhooks; critical events produce immediate notifications. We used this tool in every groing project.

8. DevOps using Kubernetes (EKS/GKE), Terraform for infra-as-code, GitHub Actions for CI/CD, Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring, and autoscaling/cost-optimization for storage retention.

9. This architecture balances cost, search/query performance, ingestion throughput, developer ergonomics, and operational simplicity.

### 2. High-level Flow

1. App uses SDK for captures error (stack, message, breadcrumbs, user, tags).

2. SDK buffers/aggregates and POSTs to /api/v1/events (HTTPS) with API key (DSN).

3. Edge proxy authenticates + rate-limits to forwards to ingestion service.

4. Ingestion service writes event to Kafka (or Kinesis).

5. Worker consumers enrich (geo, release info), compute fingerprint/group ID, update aggregations.

6. Metadata stored to ClickHouse (fast OLAP queries) and search index (OpenSearch) for text/search; raw event stored in S3 (object storage).

7. Dashboard queries Postgres for auth/org info, ClickHouse/OpenSearch for events; shows UI.

8. Alert service subscribes to important events and sends email or webhooks.

9. Real-time vs batch flows explicitly:

Real-time path: SDK → API → Kafka → Alerts → Email/Slack.
Batch path: Kafka → Workers → ClickHouse/S3 → Dashboard qu

### Components

## 1. Client SDKs

Capture errors/exceptions + metadata (env, release, user).

Offline queue, batching, retries.

Rate limiting, sampling, PII scrubbing.

Language SDKs: JS/TS, Python, Java/Kotlin, Swift/Obj-C, Go, .NET.

Transport: HTTPS JSON (optionally gRPC).

## 2. Ingestion API

API Gateway (Envoy) for TLS, auth, rate limits.

Ingestion Service (written in Go/Node for performance) validates incoming events and uses Kafka/Kinesis to ensure no data is lost, even under heavy load.

Decouples spikes with durable queue.

## 3. Processing & Storage

Workers: enrich, deduplicate, group errors.

Databases:

ClickHouse - fast analytics & aggregations.

OpenSearch - full-text search (stack traces, messages).

Postgres - orgs, projects, users.

S3 - raw event storage (cheap, durable).

Redis - caching, rate limits.

## 4. Dashboard

Frontend: React + TypeScript.

Backend: REST/GraphQL query layer.

Features: search, filters, error grouping, stack traces, alert config.

## 5. Alerts

Rules: new issue, regression, error rate > threshold.

Channels: Email, Slack, Webhooks, PagerDuty.

Engine consumes Kafka, evaluates rules in near real-time.

## 6. DevOps

Deploy on Kubernetes (EKS/GKE/AKS).

IaC: Terraform + Helm.

Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana, logs via Loki/ELK.

Backups: Postgres snapshots, ClickHouse → S3.

Tiered storage to control cost (hot 30d, cold archive in S3).

## Key Questions for Product Owner/Stackholders

# Business:

1. Who are the target users — internal teams only, or external customers as well?
2. What is the monetization model (free tier, paid plans, enterprise licensing)?

# Scale:

1. What is the expected ingestion volume (events/sec) at launch and after 12 months?
2. How many tenants/projects/users are expected to be supported?

# Compliance:

1. Are there compliance requirements (GDPR(General Data Protection Regulation), HIPAA(Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, USA), SOC2(Service Organization Control 2))?
2. Are there data residency requirements (e.g., EU-only storage)?

# Product Features:

1. Which SDK languages must be supported at launch (JS, Python, Java, Go, etc.)?
2. Which alerting/integration channels are required (Email, Slack, PagerDuty, Jira, Webhooks)?

# Operations:

1. What SLA/SLO targets are required (availability, query latency, alert delivery - e.g. 99.9% availability, <200ms query latency, alerts within 30s)?
2. Is there a preferred cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure) or need for multi-cloud/on-premise?
3. What are the budget constraints for infrastructure and storage?

### Tech Stack (short list) for discussing

- SDKs: JS, Python, Java/Kotlin, Swift, Go, .NET
- Backend: Go + Envoy + Kafka
- DBs: ClickHouse*, OpenSearch*, Postgres\*, Redis, S3
- Frontend: React + TS (Next.js)
- Infra: Kubernetes, Terraform, Prometheus, Grafana
- Email: SendGrid / SES

* - ClickHouse vs BigQuery: ClickHouse chosen for low-latency OLAP queries without vendor lock-in.
    OpenSearch vs Elastic: OpenSearch = open-source, no licensing risk.
    Postgres vs MongoDB: Postgres better for relational data (users, orgs, billing).

### Roadmap for discussing

v1: basic SDKs, error ingestion, dashboard, email alerts.
v2: advanced search, Slack/PagerDuty, anomaly detection.
v3: ML-driven error grouping, root-cause analysis.
